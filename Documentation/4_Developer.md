# Developer Guide

This guide provides a detailed step-by-step implementation plan for building the RFID Attendance System.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan â€“ Detailed

### Step 1: UI Development and Design

**Goal:** Develop the mobile app interface for student council members to manage events, register students, and monitor attendance.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Set up React Native project with necessary dependencies for navigation and API integration.
2. Design screens: Event Management, Student Registration, Attendance Logs, Scanner Connection.
3. Implement UI components for creating events, viewing students, logging attendance.
4. Connect to ESP32 hotspot and FastAPI server via API calls.
5. Add UI prompts for registering new RFID scans detected by the hardware.

**Why it matters:**

- Provides the user interface for interaction before hardware integration.
- Ensures the app handles registration and management workflows.

### Step 2: FastAPI Backend Setup

**Goal:** Set up the FastAPI server to handle database operations and API requests from both UI and hardware.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install FastAPI, Uvicorn, SqlAlchemy, SQLite.
2. Define API endpoints:

   - POST /scan: Receive UID from ESP32, check if student exists, log attendance if yes, return new_student if no.
   - POST /register: Register new student with name/grade from UI.
   - GET /students: Retrieve student list for UI.
   - POST /events: Create/manage events.
   - GET /attendance: View attendance logs.

3. Initialize SQLite database with schema from Database/schema.sql.
4. Secure API with basic auth or API keys if needed.
5. Run FastAPI server for testing with UI.

**Why it matters:**

- Backend is developed early to support UI functionality.

### Step 3: Hardware Setup

**Goal:** Prepare the ESP32 and RC522 module for scanning RFID tags and provide feedback.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. **Connect RC522 to ESP32 (SPI interface):**

   - RC522 pins: SDA, SCK, MOSI, MISO, RST
   - ESP32 pins: choose SPI-compatible pins (e.g., SDA = 21, SCK = 18, MOSI = 23, MISO = 19, RST = 22)
   - Ensure wiring is secure to prevent read errors.

2. **Connect LEDs and buzzer for feedback:**

   - Green LED: successful scan
   - Red LED: new registration needed
   - Buzzer: optional sound feedback

3. **Test basic power & connectivity:**

   - Power ESP32 via USB or battery module
   - Run a simple RC522 example sketch to verify UID reading

**Why it matters:**

- Correct wiring is critical for accurate RFID reading.
- Feedback devices improve usability for students and council members.

### Step 4: ESP32 Hotspot Setup

**Goal:** Make the ESP32 act as a Wi-Fi hotspot so the student council app or device can connect to it directly.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Use the WiFi.h library to configure an access point (AP mode):

   ```cpp
   WiFi.softAP("EventScanner_01", "password123");
   IPAddress IP = WiFi.softAPIP();
   Serial.print("AP IP address: ");
   Serial.println(IP);
   ```

2. Set SSID and password for security.
3. Test the hotspot using a mobile device or laptop to ensure it is visible and connectable.

**Why it matters:**

- Hotspot ensures wireless communication without relying on school Wi-Fi.
- Students or council members can scan and register offline from the network created by ESP32.

### Step 5: RFID Reading Logic

**Goal:** Detect and read RFID cards, determine if they are new, and prepare data for the database.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Initialize the RC522 module with the MFRC522 library.
2. Read the UID of each scanned RFID card.
3. Convert UID to a readable string format for SQL storage.
4. Check the database for existing student ID:

   - If exists, prepare to log attendance.
   - If new, trigger registration prompt (LED/buzzer or app interface).

**Sample pseudo-flow:**

Scan RFID -> Read UID -> Convert UID -> Query students table
   -> If exists: log attendance
   -> Else: prompt for registration

**Why it matters:**

- Ensures first-time scans register students properly.
- Avoids duplicate entries in the database.

### Step 6: ESP32 API Integration

**Goal:** Modify ESP32 firmware to send scan data via HTTP to FastAPI server.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Include HTTPClient.h library for ESP32.
2. After reading UID, send POST /scan request to FastAPI with UID and event_id.
3. Handle response:

   - If student exists, log success, green LED.
   - If new student, red LED, wait for registration via UI.
4. Retry on connection failure, store temporarily if offline.

**Why it matters:**

- Integrates ESP32 with backend API for centralized data handling.

### Step 7: UI / Registration Prompt

**Goal:** Prompt student council members to register new RFID IDs on first scan.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. **LED/Buzzer feedback on ESP32:**

   - Flash red LED + buzzer beep if first-time scan detected (signaled from API).

2. **Mobile app interaction:**

   - Connect to ESP32 hotspot and FastAPI server.
   - Poll API or receive notifications for new scans.
   - Show "New ID detected. Register?" prompt with UID.
   - Input name/grade/class, send POST /register to FastAPI.

**Why it matters:**

- Makes first-time registration user-friendly and controlled.
- Prevents unregistered IDs from being used without council approval.

### Step 8: Feedback Mechanism

**Goal:** Provide real-time feedback to ensure smooth scanning.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Green LED for successful scan
2. Red LED for first-time registration
3. Optional buzzer: different tones for success/failure
4. Can also display info on a small OLED screen (student name, event name)

**Why it matters:**

- Instant feedback reduces errors and confusion during events.

### Step 9: Offline Handling (Optional but Recommended)

**Goal:** Ensure scanning works even if Wi-Fi/backend connection fails.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Use EEPROM or SPIFFS to store temporary scans: UID + timestamp + event_id
2. Once connection is restored, batch upload scans via API to FastAPI server.
3. Mark synced entries as completed to avoid duplicates.

**Why it matters:**

- Avoids lost attendance records during network issues.
- Increases reliability for large school events.

### Step 10: Testing & Debugging

**Goal:** Validate the system for real-world use.

**Tasks & Details:**

1. Test individual RFID scans with known IDs
2. Test first-time registration workflow
3. Verify attendance logging to SQL database
4. Test event-specific logging (multiple events)
5. Test LED/buzzer feedback
6. Simulate offline/online scenario if implementing offline mode

**Why it matters:**

- Ensures robustness and usability.
- Identifies edge cases before deployment.

**Result:** After completing these steps, the ESP32 RFID scanner will be fully functional for wireless event attendance, first-time registration, and API-based SQLite logging, with user-friendly feedback for the student council.
