## *App Master Plan: ESP32 Wireless RFID Firmware for Event Attendance* Test

*Objective:*
We are building a *wireless ESP32 device with RC522 RFID scanner* to track attendance for school events.

* Each scan is linked to a *specific event* created/managed by the Student Council.
* First-time scans trigger a *UI prompt to register the student*.
* The device creates its *own Wi-Fi hotspot*, and sends scanned data to a *FastAPI backend server*, which manages the SQLite database.
* Visual/audio feedback confirms successful scans or new registrations.
* Optional: store scans temporarily if Wi-Fi/backend is down (for reliability).

## *Step-by-Step Implementation Plan – Detailed*

---

### *Step 1: Hardware Setup*

*Goal:* Prepare the ESP32 and RC522 module for scanning RFID tags and provide feedback.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. *Connect RC522 to ESP32 (SPI interface):*

   * RC522 pins: SDA, SCK, MOSI, MISO, RST
   * ESP32 pins: choose SPI-compatible pins (e.g., SDA = 21, SCK = 18, MOSI = 23, MISO = 19, RST = 22)
   * Ensure wiring is secure to prevent read errors.

2. *Connect LEDs and buzzer for feedback:*

   * Green LED: successful scan
   * Red LED: new registration needed
   * Buzzer: optional sound feedback

3. *Test basic power & connectivity:*

   * Power ESP32 via USB or battery module
   * Run a *simple RC522 example sketch* to verify UID reading

*Why it matters:*

* Correct wiring is critical for accurate RFID reading.
* Feedback devices improve usability for students and council members.

---

### *Step 2: ESP32 Hotspot Setup*

*Goal:* Make the ESP32 act as a Wi-Fi hotspot so the student council app or device can connect to it directly.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Use the WiFi.h library to configure an *access point (AP mode)*:

   
   WiFi.softAP("EventScanner_01", "password123");
   IPAddress IP = WiFi.softAPIP();
   Serial.print("AP IP address: ");
   Serial.println(IP);
   
2. Set SSID and password for security.
3. Test the hotspot using a mobile device or laptop to ensure it is visible and connectable.

*Why it matters:*

* Hotspot ensures wireless communication *without relying on school Wi-Fi*.
* Students or council members can scan and register offline from the network created by ESP32.

---

### *Step 3: RFID Reading Logic*

*Goal:* Detect and read RFID cards, determine if they are new, and prepare data for the database.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Initialize the RC522 module with the MFRC522 library.
2. Read the UID of each scanned RFID card.
3. Convert UID to a readable string format for SQL storage.
4. Check the database for existing student ID:

   * If *exists*, prepare to log attendance.
   * If *new*, trigger registration prompt (LED/buzzer or app interface).

*Sample pseudo-flow:*

Scan RFID -> Read UID -> Convert UID -> Query students table
   -> If exists: log attendance
   -> Else: prompt for registration

*Why it matters:*

* Ensures first-time scans register students properly.
* Avoids duplicate entries in the database.

---

### *Step 4: FastAPI Backend Development*

*Goal:* Develop the FastAPI server to handle API requests from ESP32 and UI, managing the SQLite database.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SqlAlchemy, SQLite.
2. Define API endpoints:

   * POST /scan: Receive UID from ESP32, check if student exists, log attendance if yes, return new_student if no.
   * POST /register: Register new student with name/grade from UI.
   * GET /students: Retrieve student list for UI.
   * POST /events: Create/manage events.
   * GET /attendance: View attendance logs.

3. Initialize SQLite database with schema from Database/schema.sql.
4. Secure API with basic auth or API keys if needed.
5. Run FastAPI server on the server device, accessible via HTTP over the ESP32 hotspot.

*Why it matters:*

* FastAPI provides a clean REST API for decoupling ESP32 firmware from database logic.
* Enables centralized data management and easier integration with UI.

---

### *Step 5: ESP32 API Integration*

*Goal:* Modify ESP32 firmware to send scan data via HTTP to FastAPI server.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Include HTTPClient.h library for ESP32.
2. After reading UID, send POST /scan request to FastAPI with UID and event_id.
3. Handle response:

   * If student exists, log success, green LED.
   * If new student, red LED, wait for registration via UI.
4. Retry on connection failure, store temporarily if offline.

*Why it matters:*

* Integrates ESP32 with backend API for centralized data handling.

---

### *Step 6: UI / Registration Prompt*

*Goal:* Prompt student council members to register new RFID IDs on first scan.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. *LED/Buzzer feedback on ESP32:*

   * Flash red LED + buzzer beep if first-time scan detected (signaled from API).
2. *Mobile app interaction:*

   * Connect to ESP32 hotspot and FastAPI server.
   * Poll API or receive notifications for new scans.
   * Show "New ID detected. Register?" prompt with UID.
   * Input name/grade/class, send POST /register to FastAPI.

*Why it matters:*

* Makes first-time registration *user-friendly and controlled*.
* Prevents unregistered IDs from being used without council approval.

---

### *Step 7: Feedback Mechanism*

*Goal:* Provide real-time feedback to ensure smooth scanning.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Green LED for successful scan
2. Red LED for first-time registration
3. Optional buzzer: different tones for success/failure
4. Can also display info on a small OLED screen (student name, event name)

*Why it matters:*

* Instant feedback reduces errors and confusion during events.

---

### *Step 8: Offline Handling (Optional but Recommended)*

*Goal:* Ensure scanning works even if Wi-Fi/backend connection fails.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Use *EEPROM or SPIFFS* to store temporary scans: UID + timestamp + event\_id
2. Once connection is restored, *batch upload scans* via API to FastAPI server.
3. Mark synced entries as completed to avoid duplicates.

*Why it matters:*

* Avoids lost attendance records during network issues.
* Increases reliability for large school events.

---

### *Step 9: Testing & Debugging*

*Goal:* Validate the system for real-world use.

*Tasks & Details:*

1. Test *individual RFID scans* with known IDs
2. Test *first-time registration workflow*
3. Verify *attendance logging* to SQL database
4. Test *event-specific logging* (multiple events)
5. Test *LED/buzzer feedback*
6. Simulate *offline/online scenario* if implementing offline mode

*Why it matters:*

* Ensures robustness and usability.
* Identifies edge cases before deployment.

---

✅ *Result:* After completing these steps, the ESP32 RFID scanner will be fully functional for wireless event attendance, first-time registration, and API-based SQLite logging, with user-friendly feedback for the student council.
